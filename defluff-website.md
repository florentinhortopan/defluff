# Home Page Copy

## Hero
### Headline
**The intelligence layer for modern storytelling.**

### Subhead
Defluff converts video, audio, and web content into **structured, explainable knowledge** and **guided audience journeys**—with analytics that help institutions improve learning and engagement over time.

### Primary CTA
**Request a demo**

### Secondary CTA
**Explore the platform**

### Credibility strip (short)
Built for **museums, exhibit organizers, educational companies, and institutions** that need clarity, trust, and measurable impact.

---

## Problem → Promise
### The problem
Audiences are overwhelmed by volume, speed, and fragmented context. Institutions are asked to educate and inspire, but most media is not designed for retention, guidance, or outcomes.

### The promise
Defluff makes media *usable*. It extracts meaning, packages it into knowledge assets, and orchestrates journeys that feel curated, rigorous, and personal—without requiring your team to start from scratch.

---

## What Defluff does (3 pillars)
### 1) Understand
Defluff analyzes content, segments it into moments, and surfaces topics, definitions, claims, and key takeaways with provenance.

### 2) Curate
Defluff assembles content into guided sequences—lessons, exhibit routes, learning modules, or visitor “journeys”—tailored to your audience.

### 3) Measure
Defluff captures engagement and learning signals to improve curation quality and justify outcomes to stakeholders.

---

## Outcomes (institutional language)
Defluff is designed to deliver outcomes institutions can defend, repeat, and scale: faster production cycles, consistent quality, stronger comprehension, higher engagement, and evidence for reporting, renewals, and funding narratives.

---

## Social proof placeholders
(Replace with real partners later.)
- “Reduced time-to-curate by **X%** across our content library.”
- “Visitors stayed **Y minutes longer** and completed guided journeys more often.”
- “We increased lesson completion by **Z%** without increasing editorial headcount.”

---

## CTA band
**Defluff is licensed as a platform—so your team can build repeatable storytelling systems, not one-off experiments.**  
Request a demo to see how your content becomes journeys with measurable results.

---

# Platform Page (`/product`)

## Product headline
**A platform that turns media into knowledge and guided experiences.**

## Product description
Defluff is a modular platform that can operate as (1) a content intelligence engine, (2) a curation system, or (3) a full delivery layer for web, kiosk, and embedded experiences.

---

## Core modules (copy blocks)

### Defluff Engine (Content Intelligence)
The Engine transforms raw media into structured outputs: topics, entities, segments, key moments, definitions, claims, summaries, and “what to remember.” Each output is designed for editorial review and can be exported via API or files.

### Knowledge Cards
Knowledge Cards are reusable, governed building blocks: concepts, clips, definitions, evidence, and relationships. They are designed to move from analysis to delivery without losing traceability.

### Journey Builder
Journey Builder assembles media and Knowledge Cards into guided sequences. Journeys can be educational modules, exhibit routes, thematic trails, or onboarding paths—each with rules for audience type, time available, and desired outcomes.

### Defluff Score (Quality & Density Signals)
Defluff Score helps teams identify clarity, density, novelty, and coherence. It supports quality governance across large libraries and mixed contributor ecosystems.

### Experience Layer (Web, Kiosk, Embed)
Defluff can deliver curated journeys as a branded web experience, a kiosk experience for exhibits, or an embedded overlay inside existing players.

### Measurement Layer (Analytics & Outcomes)
Defluff measures engagement at the segment level, across journeys, and by cohort. It supports continuous improvement and creates defensible reporting for stakeholders.

---

## Integrations (conceptual, replace with actual)
Defluff is designed to integrate with content libraries, LMS platforms, DAM systems, and exhibit delivery stacks through APIs and export formats.

---

# Solutions Page (`/solutions`)

## Solutions intro
Defluff is built for organizations that need to curate at scale, protect trust, and prove outcomes. Below are solution narratives you can use as section blocks.

---

## Museums & Cultural Institutions
### What changes with Defluff
Defluff turns collections and media into curated, guided visitor journeys that continue after the visit—without diluting institutional rigor.

### Typical deployments
A QR-driven exhibit layer, a kiosk mode for on-site experience, and a take-home recap that reinforces learning.

### Why it matters
Museums increasingly compete for attention, but their advantage is depth. Defluff helps turn depth into experiences audiences actually complete and remember.

---

## Exhibit Organizers & Experience Studios
### What changes with Defluff
Defluff provides a repeatable platform layer for building new exhibits faster: content becomes journeys, journeys become measurable outcomes, and every iteration makes the next launch easier.

### Typical deployments

---

## Educational Companies & Academies
### What changes with Defluff
Defluff transforms content libraries into governed learning modules. It reduces manual course operations while improving clarity and completion.

### Typical deployments
Course content intelligence, lesson sequencing, knowledge cards for quizzes/assignments, and cohort analytics for iteration.

### Why it matters
Better outcomes do not require more content. They require better structure, guidance, and measurement.

---

## Public Media & Learning Platforms
### What changes with Defluff
Defluff adds an intelligence layer on top of existing media catalogs to create guided viewing experiences that increase retention, comprehension, and trust.

---

# How It Works (`/how-it-works`)

## Architecture headline
**Designed for clarity, governance, and scale.**

## High-level pipeline
Defluff ingests content, segments it, extracts meaning into structured Knowledge Cards, assembles curated Journeys, delivers experiences across web/kiosk/embed, and measures engagement to continuously improve both curation and content quality.

---

## Architecture sections

### 1) Ingestion
Defluff supports batch and incremental processing of media and documents, enabling both back-catalog conversion and ongoing updates.

### 2) Understanding Layer
Defluff performs multi-step extraction: segmentation, topic modeling, entity resolution, claim detection, definition extraction, and takeaway generation—paired with confidence signals.

### 3) Knowledge Layer
Structured Knowledge Cards are stored with relationships, enabling cross-collection intelligence and reuse across exhibits or curricula.

### 4) Experience Layer
Journeys are delivered through a branded UI layer (web/kiosk/embed) with personalization rules.

### 5) Measurement Layer
Defluff captures segment-level engagement, journey completion, replays, drop-offs, and cohort comparisons to inform continuous improvement.

---

## Trust, Safety, and Governance

### Explainability
Defluff is designed to show “what was extracted” and “where it came from,” so your team can audit, edit, and approve.

### Human-in-the-loop
Defluff supports review workflows so editorial teams can approve outputs, lock canonical definitions, and create institution-grade narratives.

### Provenance and traceability
Defluff can retain linkable provenance references to support trust and institutional accountability.

### Audience modes
Defluff can support strict modes for education and youth contexts, enabling stronger filtering and curated experiences.

### Brand and tone controls
Defluff can align output style with institutional language, reading level, and terminology.
