# SvelteKit Project Rules
- Use Svelte stores for state management, not React hooks
- Separate data logic into stores, keep components presentation-only
- Follow SvelteKit file-based routing conventions
- Use TypeScript with proper typing
- Prefer Svelte's reactive syntax ($: for derived state)
- Use SvelteKit's built-in features (load functions, form actions)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Keep components simple and focused
- Use semantic HTML and accessibility best practices
